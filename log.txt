Day 25 - 12/12:
Finished up the regex for the conditionals.
Well, the regex part was simple. The hard part was figuring our the right data structures for the job.
I made some changes that I don't quite remember... but I've documented the specifics
on the .js file and the outline document so that I don't forget.
Also made some structure changes to things involving interaction. Multiple outcomes are possible
based on what you have on hand and the conditions in the game, so I've accounted for that.
Anyway, finished prompting and item collecting data strctures. Should be able to finish the up in 1 or 2 days.
Result : Parsed Prompts and Collections

Day 24 - 12/10:
Worked more on the regex!
Got the exits parsed and started on parsing prompts.
Which requires conditional and variable parsing...
From the looks of it, I should be able to easily knock out everything else if I do this right, though.
Result : Parsed Exits for Each Room + Started on Prompt Parsing

Day 23 - 12/9:
Spent a bit more time looking into regex.
Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be a super easy way to do regex for everything...
Except with a while loop. For each regex. I think that might work.
But otherwise, got name parsing done.
Result : Name is Parsed for each Room

Day 22 - 12/3:
Decided to put off working on director and figured out how to setup a local server. (It works!)
But been struggling with str.match(regex) or whatever. Will figure out next time.
Tip - Hold reload while inspect element is open to force reload the site.
Result : Got Site to Load and Started on Regex

Day 21 - 11/26:
Looked into implementing the regex...
And found a way to do it! I've made some fixes and modifications to the Regex expressions for that.
Some of them just didn't work? I don't know.
But for some reason the file system read .txt file stuff doesn't work.
Result : Regex Fixes + Understanding

Day 20 - 11/22:
Ok... got way too much done today...
Created the .txt syntax... and it's really fucking good.
And it should work, barring the lock puzzle... which will require an if statement.
My main worry now is that now that I have a good idea of what I want out of the AI, is there
really a point to saving the information to a .txt first?
You definitely can export it and create adventures easier, sure...
But then again, the point of making this was to make it so that I could read in that text adventure
I made a few weeks ago.
Result : Finished .txt Syntax

Day 19 - 11/21:
It's been a while again! Tests and shit, you know.
It includes some inventory, lock things, and navigation.
Though, I will say I'm still unsure how to index neighbors.
Result : Finished Planning

Day 18 - 11/12:
Presentations are over!
Started planning on the graph structure.
3D.
Result : Some Graph Planning

Day 17 - 10/21:
It's been a little while...
We've been doing presentations for the past few weeks, which is why.
Anyways, I've knocked out a COMPLETE text adventure for testing.
Except I have multi tomorrow. WHY??? SO I COULDN'T IMPORT IT!!!
Result : Made Text Adventure for Testing

Day 16 - 10/7:
Made a slideshow on that day (this is a reflection from friday :< )
And I've modified it since! I think it's fine, but I'm kinda iffy about the "everything app" part??
Result : Made a Hook Slideshow

Day 15 - 9/30:
Started out with working on trying to ge text to update whenever I change the range value.
And I've seen various events, buut none of them work??? I dunno...
But then realized that I should be working on the introduction!
So then I've started working on that. I don't know if it'll be done by the end of today, we'll see...
Result : Got a good start on the Introduction


Day 14 - 9/24:
Yeah no I'm basically studying way too much now...
Got geo today, had multi yesterday, gonna have physics tomorrow...
But made it so that when you input a text thing a response pops up that tells you what you typed.
Which is neat, I guess. I just wonder how I'm going to use that value...
While I would like it to slide out in a nice clean way, I don't think there's a need to polish the prompts just yet.
But I did do one thing - made sure that you can input tags! Like, italics!
Which I should have taken a lot less time than it did.
Result : Added in Basic Prompt Displaying

Day 13 - 9/23:
I've been worrying about multi for a while, but I think I should work right now.
The issue is I'm not sure what to do! All main things related to the UI are done.
EXCEPT for the dynamically scaling UI. But that can come later!
I think my focus should be inputting something and it popping back at you as a text prompt when you press enter.
Result : Started on JS and whatnot

Day 12 - 9/19:
I've been mildly selling but whatever! I'm gonna work hard now.
I want to have sliders styling properly and add in some buttons at the bottom of the UI.
And not just any buttons! I want there to be a gradient or something that wiggles when you touch it.
...So, I only did some parts of the slider :c
There's a lot more going on since Bootstrap has a war with HTML for some reason?
And when I try to change the default input thing, it says lol no and just combines itself with Bootstrap???
I think I'll be back to work on this later...
Ok, I'm back
I've added in some buttons at the bottom of the sidebar.
Which is fine! Could've done more but whatever!
Result : Made Sidebars Kinda Prettier and Added Generation Buttons

Day 11 - 9/12:
Decided to hit the grind! Because why not! Also because there's a presentation of some sort tomorrow!
So I forgot to push my changes via github on 9/10, so I snuck into Mr. Tra's room at the end of 8A today to push to origin!
Also learned about codespaces from Eric which... work, but just don't feel nice (and need a command to test, as opposed to Alt + `)...
Anyways, after all that, I did a bit of formatting and then came home for the real grind...
Which was the sidebar! I replaced the old Bootstrap stuff with new import links to the stylesheets (or something) and put the JS imports in the right place.
Then, I made the sidebar! Thankfully, after not too much searching, I found that Bootstrap 5 had a very easy-to-follow tutorial!
...that I basically copied. BUT I had to modify it a lot because it didn't fit in and was unnecessarily complicated, so it's NOT a academic integrity violation!
So in the sidebar, there is a textarea and some sliders that don't work properly nor have indicators for much, but this is essentially a half-working mockup soooooo...
Could use some bottom buttons later on! Will look into that later!
I've also added in some more sample prompts to showcase the scrolling (crazy, I know).
I'll be making a presentation for a bit, but otherwise I'm done for today. See you later!
Result : Added in a Partially Working Sidebar

Day 10 - 9/10:
I'm back! I have multi to worry about today but I'm gonna focus on this anyways...
So my goal for today is to get at least SOMETHING popping out of the left by the end of class.
Try renaming every class - bootstrap might be overriding some of yours.
...NVM! This is me on wednesday reporting that that sidebar was never a thing!
But! I got ready for it on this day by adding in bootstrap, which was its own struggle...
Result : Added in Bootstrap

Day 9 - 9/9:
Okay. I'm starting this early as a challenge to see if I can get things done fast!
So today,  let's get started on making a sidebar and cleaning up the UI.
...Ok, I'm finished for today (I would like to do more though...)
The bottom bar is now just by itself, which is nice
And after a LOT of wrangling, I got the top bar to finally have a button chilling on the left!
My goal for this week is to get a sidebar popping out when I press the button, one way or another!
Result : Added in Top Bar Button

Day 8 - 9/5:
Implemented a bunch of UI shadows, roundness, and borders...
And it looks nice! Ishan said it looks like bootleg ChatGPT and yeah, it literally is 
But I'm trying to get a confirm button (and it doesn't work??)
So I think I'll just make it so you can press enter to confirm.
(It's a text adventure after all)
Really wanted to do a sidebar today (basic JS!!!) but I guess that will have to wait.
Result : UI Border Tweaks + No More Input Button

Day 7 - 9/3:
Okay, Flexbox is really helpful! Today was dedicated mainly to integrating it and polishing some UI things, specifically sizing and not making the sidebar look bad.
I applied Flexbox into the main scrolling area, along with the sidebar.
Also, changed the prompt class to look good even when the only thing in there is normal text.
Which looks pretty good! Nice.
If there isn't enough time, I'm thinking about leaving the generation bar for later... or not, I dunno.
I've searched up some animation things, so I don't think it'd be that hard to do.
And I still need to add in a button for the input stuff.
Result : Scaling Changes and Flexbox Implementation

Day 6 - 8/29:
Been continuing working on the main interaction area, which is going (???)
Looking into Flexbox per Mr. Tra's recommendation, seems very helpful
Result : Added in Scrollable UI and Input Bar

Day 5 - 8/27:
Bootstrap seems a bit too complicated for me for now... I'll go back later when I'm more experienced...
Anyways, made a sidebar that works, but it doesn't look super nice when you zoom out.
Also added in a subsection for the game menu. It scrolls pretty nicely, but it doesn't yet align to the center of the grid... yikes
I could pretty easily add in an input bar at the very bottom, I think. It would just involve turning the game part into a grid, and then a column format thingy.
The ONE thing I don't like about this, though, is that when you zoom out, everything gets messed up pretty badly. 
Seriously thinking of switching to Godot (no downsides, except that I don't learn HTML as much... but then again, that's what college is for).
Like, in Godot, not only would I be learning game dev, but also have an easier time creating an even better GUI than possible with HTML.
Will decide during the break later this week.
Result : Sidebar visually complete, Main Area has a bit of work, Began Contemplation of whether I should use Godot

Day 4:
Started a Github repository! Nice.
Tried making a column layout, ended up with only a title.
Will pursue a grid layout next time.
Ishan told me that Bootstrap might be helpful? I will have a look next time.
Result : main page started, with title bar

Day 3:
Talked to a friend and he suggested that I could use Flutterflow for creating UI, but then he said that that was too easy and that I should use HTML instead.
Said that I would use HTML but have decided on using Flutterflow. I don’t know how it works, but I’m sure it’ll be easy.
Honestly, I don’t know how either of them work. 
So far, the main and generation screens are done.
Advisory smells like maple syrup.
Ok, now the start screen is done.
Played cave adventure game or whatever it’s called. It’s cool!
Result : start, main, and generation screens complete.

Day 2:
Turns out my project proposal wasn’t that good (yikes) and so I redid it.
Moved to Canva to continue work on the UI.
Decided today that I would generate the game based on the following:
Store a prompt from the reader.
Using code, generate a pattern of rooms, locks, and interactions on those rooms.
Ask the AI to generate descriptions for each of those rooms and items, storing the result.
Present the resulting adventure to the player.
Result : Redid Project Proposal

Day 1:
Dr. Tra (or is it Mr.? i dunno) forced me to decide what my project was going to be.
Was initially thinking about making it an AI-generated RPG, but decided on a text adventure (because that is easier).
Also started on a UI in google slides.
Result : Project Proposal Complete
