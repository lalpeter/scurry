Day 8 - 9/5:
Implemented a bunch of UI shadows, roundness, and borders...
And it looks nice! Ishan said it looks like bootleg ChatGPT and yeah, it literally is 
But I'm trying to get a confirm button (and it doesn't work??)
So I think I'll just make it so you can press enter to confirm.
(It's a text adventure after all)
Really wanted to do a sidebar today (basic JS!!!) but I guess that will have to wait.
Result : UI Border Tweaks + No More Input Button


Day 7 - 9/3:
Okay, Flexbox is really helpful! Today was dedicated mainly to integrating it and polishing some UI things, specifically sizing and not making the sidebar look bad.
I applied Flexbox into the main scrolling area, along with the sidebar.
Also, changed the prompt class to look good even when the only thing in there is normal text.
Which looks pretty good! Nice.
If there isn't enough time, I'm thinking about leaving the generation bar for later... or not, I dunno.
I've searched up some animation things, so I don't think it'd be that hard to do.
And I still need to add in a button for the input stuff.
Result : Scaling Changes and Flexbox Implementation

Day 6 - 8/29:
Been continuing working on the main interaction area, which is going (???)
Looking into Flexbox per Mr. Tra's recommendation, seems very helpful
Result : Added in Scrollable UI and Input Bar

Day 5 - 8/27:
Bootstrap seems a bit too complicated for me for now... I'll go back later when I'm more experienced...
Anyways, made a sidebar that works, but it doesn't look super nice when you zoom out.
Also added in a subsection for the game menu. It scrolls pretty nicely, but it doesn't yet align to the center of the grid... yikes
I could pretty easily add in an input bar at the very bottom, I think. It would just involve turning the game part into a grid, and then a column format thingy.
The ONE thing I don't like about this, though, is that when you zoom out, everything gets messed up pretty badly. 
Seriously thinking of switching to Godot (no downsides, except that I don't learn HTML as much... but then again, that's what college is for).
Like, in Godot, not only would I be learning game dev, but also have an easier time creating an even better GUI than possible with HTML.
Will decide during the break later this week.
Result : Sidebar visually complete, Main Area has a bit of work, Began Contemplation of whether I should use Godot

Day 4:
Started a Github repository! Nice.
Tried making a column layout, ended up with only a title.
Will pursue a grid layout next time.
Ishan told me that Bootstrap might be helpful? I will have a look next time.
Result : main page started, with title bar

Day 3:
Talked to a friend and he suggested that I could use Flutterflow for creating UI, but then he said that that was too easy and that I should use HTML instead.
Said that I would use HTML but have decided on using Flutterflow. I don’t know how it works, but I’m sure it’ll be easy.
Honestly, I don’t know how either of them work. 
So far, the main and generation screens are done.
Advisory smells like maple syrup.
Ok, now the start screen is done.
Played cave adventure game or whatever it’s called. It’s cool!
Result : start, main, and generation screens complete.

Day 2:
Turns out my project proposal wasn’t that good (yikes) and so I redid it.
Moved to Canva to continue work on the UI.
Decided today that I would generate the game based on the following:
Store a prompt from the reader.
Using code, generate a pattern of rooms, locks, and interactions on those rooms.
Ask the AI to generate descriptions for each of those rooms and items, storing the result.
Present the resulting adventure to the player.
Result : Redid Project Proposal

Day 1:
Dr. Tra (or is it Mr.? i dunno) forced me to decide what my project was going to be.
Was initially thinking about making it an AI-generated RPG, but decided on a text adventure (because that is easier).
Also started on a UI in google slides.
Result : Project Proposal Complete
