Day 4:
Started a Github repository! Nice.

Day 3:
Talked to a friend and he suggested that I could use Flutterflow for creating UI, but then he said that that was too easy and that I should use HTML instead.
Said that I would use HTML but have decided on using Flutterflow. I don’t know how it works, but I’m sure it’ll be easy.
Honestly, I don’t know how either of them work. 
So far, the main and generation screens are done.
Advisory smells like maple syrup.
Ok, now the start screen is done.
Played cave adventure game or whatever it’s called. It’s cool!
Result : start, main, and generation screens complete.

Day 2:
Turns out my project proposal wasn’t that good (yikes) and so I redid it.
Moved to Canva to continue work on the UI.
Decided today that I would generate the game based on the following:
Store a prompt from the reader.
Using code, generate a pattern of rooms, locks, and interactions on those rooms.
Ask the AI to generate descriptions for each of those rooms and items, storing the result.
Present the resulting adventure to the player.
Result : Redid Project Proposal

Day 1:
Dr. Tra (or is it Mr.? i dunno) forced me to decide what my project was going to be.
Was initially thinking about making it an AI-generated RPG, but decided on a text adventure (because that is easier).
Also started on a UI in google slides.
Result : Project Proposal Complete
